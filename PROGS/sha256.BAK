* This example assumes the Chilkat API to have been previously unlocked.
* See Global Unlock Sample for sample code.

loCrypt = CreateObject('Chilkat_9_5_0.Crypt2')

* The output will be Hex, so set the EncodingMode:
loCrypt.EncodingMode = "hex"

* Set the hash algorithm:
* Choices are: md5, sha-1, sha256, sha384, sha512, md2, haval
loCrypt.HashAlgorithm = "sha256"

* Set the HMAC key:
loCrypt.SetHmacKeyEncoded("The_API_Secret","ascii")
lcMac = loCrypt.HmacStringENC("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
? lcMac
